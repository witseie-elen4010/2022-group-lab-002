# USING ARRAYS TO STORE DATA INSTEAD OF DATABASE
Date: 2022-May-19

## Status
Accepted

## Context
An array was used to store the target waords (words to be guessed). A Word API may be used instead of this.

## Decision
This was done for simplicity and to get a proof of concept

## Consequences
The array made the file large.
Made word comoaring difficult.
